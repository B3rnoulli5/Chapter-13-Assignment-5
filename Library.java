//Caleb Hedin, Assignment 4, 2/15/2024
//Pretty cool assignment. I used online databases to find ISBNS, and the UI is similar to the grocery list assignment that we created.
//Learn sorting and searching methods. I had a hard time with the searching methods, and you can tell because I used a boolean.
//The search methods are a little hard because I have everything case sensitive and spelling has to be perfect. But I think it's a good start.
//I should also use a .read method and have a database for the library. I think that would make things more clear.
